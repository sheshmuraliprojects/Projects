# Shesh Sai Murali â€“ Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository! This collection showcases my academic, technical, and interdisciplinary work across data science, machine learning, UX/UI, and statistical modelling. Below is a brief description of each project report included.

## Project Descriptions

- **AFL_Data_Analysis_Final_Report.pdf**  
  Exploratory and predictive analysis of AFL data across multiple seasons using Python. Applied k-NN and regression models to extract trends in player performance and match conditions.

- **Data_Science_in_Action_Case_Study_Essay.pdf**  
  Analytical essay examining real-world data science applications in public health, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring (e.g., COVID-19 tracking and MethaneSAT).

- **E-Waste_Recycling_App_HighFidelity_Prototype_Report.pdf**  
  A UX/UI design project creating a high-fidelity Figma prototype for an e-waste recycling app, supported by usability principles and heuristic evaluation.

- **Effective_Data_Visualisation_Principles_Essay.pdf**  
  Essay discussing key principles of data visualisation and storytelling, with examples of effective and poor visual communication in real-world contexts.

- **Ethics_in_Data_Science_Case_Study_Essay.pdf**  
  An evaluation of ethical challenges in data science, covering surveillance capitalism, algorithmic bias, and ethical data use in targeted advertising.

- **Geomagnetic_Storm_Forecasting_DST_Prediction_Report.pdf**  
  Machine learning project applying LSTM, CNN, and GRU models to predict geomagnetic storm severity using the DST index and sunspot data.

- **Qantas_Big_Data_Applications_Essay.pdf**  
  Case study essay analysing how Qantas uses big data for operational optimisation, customer engagement, and predictive analytics.

- **Statistical_Modelling_and_Classification_Report.pdf**  
  Statistical modelling using R, including linear/logistic regression, decision trees, and k-NN, applied to health and concrete strength datasets.

- **Temperature_Energy_Demand_Modelling_Australia.pdf**  
  Group data science project modelling the relationship between air temperature, energy demand, and rooftop solar generation in Australia.

- **Virtual_Internship_Communication_Modelling_Report.pdf**
